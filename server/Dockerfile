# Dockerfile for production build of Ingredientory API

# Note: we copy over the package.json separately so that this layer's cache (installing the dependencies) 
#       will only be invalidated if either package.json or package-lock.json changes
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json and package-lock.json are copied
COPY package*.json ./
